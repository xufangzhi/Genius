# 📝 Implementation of Foresight Sampling

The sampling process consists of two parts: (1) explore and reward the steps with *foresight*; (2) exploit and construct training data with re-sampling technique.

The former one is implemented in ``foresight_sampling_with_vllm.py``, and the latter is in ``construct_foresight_preference_data.py``.
